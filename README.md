# Utah Avalanche Analysis Dashboard

### Overview

The dashboard is a Python-based data analysis project designed to explore and better understand avalanches in Utah, leveraging data from the Utah Avalanche Center (UAC). The primary goal of this project is to enhance my skills in Python and data analysis while gaining deeper insights into Utah's snowpack and avalanche activity.

This project serves as a learning tool and is a work in progress. I plan to maintain and expand it over time, refining the analysis and adding new features as I continue to develop my technical and analytical skills.

### Data Source

All data is gathered from the Utah Avalanche Center (UAC). The UAC tracks all backcountry observations of Utah's snowpack and avalanches on its website: [Utah Avalanche Center Observations](https://utahavalanchecenter.org/observations).

### Educational Purpose

This dashboard was created strictly for educational purposes. It allows me to better understand Utah's snowpack dynamics while providing a platform to practice and improve my Python programming skills.

### Observations and Hypotheses

- **Observation**: The northeast aspect consistently experiences the highest number of avalanches.  
  **Hypothesis**: This is due to consistent wind loading, with westerly winds depositing snow on east-facing slopes. Additionally, being in the Northern Hemisphere, Utah's north-facing slopes receive less sunlight, leading to colder temperatures and increased faceting.

- **Observation**: The largest weak layer in Utah is consistently caused by faceting, except for instances of a new snow/old snow interface (e.g., crusts, facets, or surface hoar) observed in 2019/2020 and 2016/2017.  
**Hypothesis**: The 2019/2020 and 2016/2017 seasons experienced record-breaking and consistent snowfall throughout.

- **Observation**: Salt Lake has the most recorded weak layers.  
**Hypothesis**: Salt Lake sees the most backcountry traffic due to its abundant snowfall and easy access from nearby large populations.

- **Observation**: The data contradicts the initial assumption that larger avalanches are more likely to result in burial.  
**Hypothesis**: There is no strong correlation between avalanche size and the likelihood of full burial.

- **Observation**: February 2021 recorded the highest number of avalanches.  
**Hypothesis**: This was due to record snowfall over a short period on a faceted weak layer.

### Future Plans

This project is ongoing, and I plan to:

- Continue refining the data analysis and visualizations.
- Prove or disprove my hypothesis.
- Automate the data input (e.g., web scrapping)
- Explore additional datasets (e.g., weather) and integrate more advanced analytical techniques.
- Expand the dashboardâ€™s functionality to include predictive modeling and interactive visualizations.
