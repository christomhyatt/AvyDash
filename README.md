All data is gathered from the Utah Avalanch Center (UAC). The UAC tracks all backcountry observations of Utah's snowpack and avalanches on its website (https://utahavalanchecenter.org/observations).

**This dashboard was created strictly for educational purposes to understand Utah's snowpack better and practice my Python.**

**Observation**: The northeast aspect consistently experiences the highest number of avalanches.
**Hypothesis**: This is due to consistent wind loading, with westerly winds depositing snow on east-facing slopes. Additionally, being in the Northern Hemisphere, Utah's north-facing slopes receive less sunlight, leading to colder temperatures and increased faceting.

**Observation**: The largest weak layer in Utah is consistently caused by faceting, except for instances of a new snow/old snow interface (e.g., crusts, facets, or surface hoar) observed in 2019/2020 and 2016/2017.
**Hypothesis**: The 2019/2020 and 2016/2017 seasons experienced record-breaking and consistent snowfall throughout.

**Observation**: Salt Lake has the most recorded week layers.
**Hypothesis**: Salt Lake sees the most backcountry traffic due to its abundant snowfall and easy access from nearby large populations.

**Observation**: The data contradicts the initial assumption that larger avalanches are more likely to result in burial.
**Hypothesis**: There is no strong correlation between avalanche size and the likelihood of full burial.

**Observation**: February 2021 recorded the highest number of avalanches.
**Hypothesis**: This was due to record snowfall over a short period on a faceted weak layer.
